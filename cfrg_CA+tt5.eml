Robert,

In your scenario, you want "with replacement", meaning that the probability
of receiving a later packet is not modified by the result of earlier
trials. (As opposed to drawing colored marbles from a bag "without
replacement", where drawing a blue marble reduces the probability that the
next marble will be blue.)

Specifically, with your scenario where your packet reception rate is 95%
(p=0.95), and the total number of packets sent is 5 (n=5), and you want to
know the probability that at least 3 packets were received, you want to
evaluate the CDF at k=2 (get the chance that two or fewer packets were
received), and then subtract that from one. This can be done using the
summation formula for the CDF shown here with k=2, n=5, p=0.95.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function

(The summation formula iterates over i, the number of successful trials
(received packets), and multiplies n choose i (the number of permutations
of successful trials) by p^(i)*(1-p)^(n-i) (the probability of any
individual permutation being found)).

The Binomial CDF is available as an Excel function:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/binom-dist-function-c5ae37b6-f39c-4be2-94c2-509a1480770c
In your example, I think you would do this:
=1-BINOM.DIST(2,5,0.95,TRUE)
Which comes to 99.88% for receiving at least 3 out of 5 packets.

I think the result in your original post is not correct. You wanted the
probability that at least 2 out of 3 packets would be received. There are
four ways that this could happen: all 3 packets are received, or the first
one is dropped, or the second one is dropped, or the third one is dropped.
This uses the following probabilities:
= (0.95*0.95*0.95) + (0.05*0.95*0.95) + (0.95*0.05*0.95) + (0.95*0.95*0.05)
This comes to 99.275%, which agrees with the BINOM.DIST function with these
parameters:
=1-BINOM.DIST(1,3,0.95,TRUE)

Hopefully I have correctly understood the question.
Regards,
Dan
